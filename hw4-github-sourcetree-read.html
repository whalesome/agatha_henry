  	<h1>Homework 4: GitHub + SourceTree</h1>

    <h3>Estimated Time</h3>
    <p>1 - 2 days</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this assignment you will create an account on github and download SourceTree, allowing us to collaborate with the git source control system.</p>
    <p>This will allow us to share files without having to send it over Slack every time we need to make a change to a file.</p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Goto <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com/</a> and create a new account.</p>
    <p>Download <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">https://www.sourcetreeapp.com</a> and install it on your computer.</p>
    <p>Open SourceTree and click New Repository, create a repository for <a href="https://github.com/talekhinezh/agathahenry.git">https://github.com/talekhinezh/agathahenry.git</a></p>
    <p>Locate the folder of your repository. You should see all of our previous homeworks.</p>
    <p>Locate the file in the folder called hw4-secret.html and open it in your browser. There should be a video with a secret code in it.</p>

    <p>Goto <a href="https://app.diginidocodingschool.com/">https://app.diginidocodingschool.com/</a>, login with your GitHub account and enter your secret code. Once you're done with that you will be able to see your personal Dashboard for Diginido Coding School.</p>
    <p>Once you're done with that notify me on Slack.</p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>
