  	<h1>Homework 5: Adding a file to Github</h1>

    <h3>Estimated Time</h3>
    <p>1 - 2 days</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this homework we will be adding a file to github. This is useful so that other developers you are working with can read any changes you write to any file in whatever project you are working on.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Copy this file hw5-github-source-tree-write.html into that folder</p>
    <p>Go into SourceTree, Click on Uncommitted changes</p>
    <p>You should see hw5-github-source-tree-write.html under Unstaged files, check it</p>
    <p>Click Commit on the top left of SourceTree</p>
    <p>In the box below write a description like "hw5!"</p>
    <p>Check "Push changes immediately to origin/master"</p>
    <p>Press Commit on the bottom right</p>
    <p>Wait for SourceTree to finish committing to github</p>
    <p>When that's done, you've successfully uploaded your first file. Let me know on Slack. Congrats!</p>
